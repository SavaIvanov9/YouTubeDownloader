# YouTube Downloader

## Description:
Tool for downloading videos and playlists from YouTube and convert them in mp3 format if needed.
I needed one and I have decided to implement it for fun :) Currently it has console client interface. In future I will develop some
shiny desktop, web and mobile versions.

## Available commands:

### -Download videos
Download videos from youtube. Store the links in "youtube-links-to-download.txt" each on new row. Files will be stored in 
"downloaded-files" folder. Add "-mp3" as optional parameter to convert output in mp3 format. Add "-init" as optional parameter to initialize input file.

### -Download whole playlists
Download videos from playlist in youtube. Store the links of playlists in "youtube-playlists-to-download.txt" each on new row. Files
will be saved in "downloaded-playlists" folder. Add "-mp3" as optional parameter to convert output in mp3 format. Add "-init" as optional parameter to initialize input file.
